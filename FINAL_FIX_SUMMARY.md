# Final Fix Summary - Tensor Dimension Mismatch RESOLVED

## The Root Cause
The issue was that `canvas_image` had **5 dimensions** instead of 4:
- **Actual**: `torch.Size([1, 1, 1080, 1920, 3])` - 5D tensor
- **Expected**: `torch.Size([1, 1080, 1920, 3])` - 4D tensor

This extra dimension was causing tensor slicing to extract from the wrong dimensions, resulting in shape mismatches during the blending operation.

## Why It Happened
In the `inpaint_stitch` method (line 1274), the code was doing:
```python
canvas_image.unsqueeze(0)
```
But `canvas_image` already had a batch dimension from `stitcher['canvas_image'][idx]`, so this was adding an unnecessary extra dimension.

## The Two-Part Fix

### Part 1: Prevent Extra Dimension (line 1273-1277)
```python
# Check if canvas_image needs batch dimension
if canvas_image.dim() == 3:  # If it's HWC, add batch dimension
    canvas_image = canvas_image.unsqueeze(0)
# If it's already 4D (BHWC), use as is
```
Now we only add a batch dimension if needed, not blindly.

### Part 2: Safety Check (line 1306-1309)
```python
# Ensure canvas_image is 4D (BHWC), not 5D
if canvas_image.dim() == 5:
    # If shape is [1, 1, H, W, C] or [B, 1, H, W, C], squeeze the extra dimension
    canvas_image = canvas_image.squeeze(1)
```
This handles any cases where a 5D tensor might still slip through.

## Result
- Canvas extraction now works correctly: `canvas_image[:, y:y+h, x:x+w, :]`
- Tensor dimensions match during blending operation
- No more "tensor a (538) must match tensor b (1920)" errors

## Testing
The workflow should now run without dimension mismatch errors. The InpaintStitchImproved node will correctly:
1. Extract the right region from the canvas
2. Resize the inpainted image and mask to match
3. Blend them together
4. Paste back onto the canvas

## Additional Fixes Made
While debugging, I also fixed the tensor slicing operations to properly handle the channel dimension (`:` at the end), though the main issue was the extra batch dimension.
